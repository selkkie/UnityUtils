# UnityUtils
Various handy things I use in most every Unity project.

Includes: 

## UnityLoader.js
A unity loader that has no logo. 

## TransformDeepChildExtension.cs
An extension that lets you use transform.Find() on grandchildren.

## EditorUtils.cs
Some basic handy utilities:
### Window Folding
Lets you fold or unfold everything in the hierarchy at once.
### Group Objects
Ctrl+G will group GameObjects together into an empty.
